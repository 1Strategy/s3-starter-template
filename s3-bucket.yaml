  Purpose:
    Description: "This template is used to create a single S3 bucket for basic object storage. Parameters 
                  provide the ability to use S3 canned ACLs, enable default encryption (with or without a
                  custom KMS Key) and enable object versioning.  On successful resource creation both the 
                  bucket url and arn will be exported and available for import in other CloudFormation 
                  templates."
